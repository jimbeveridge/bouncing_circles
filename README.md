# Bouncing Circles

An example Flutter project that demonstrates how to use CustomPaint.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online
[documentation](http://flutter.io/).

Once you start the app, you'll see a single circle animating. Each time
you tap the screen, a new circle will be added.

Tap the 'X' in the bottom right to clear the screen and start over.
